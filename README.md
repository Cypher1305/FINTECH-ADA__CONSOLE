# Fintech_ada (Java Console Application)

**Fintech_ada** is a console-based Java application designed to simulate a simple fintech ecosystem. It was developed as part of a revision project to reinforce core Java concepts, MySQL database integration, and essential design patterns.

## Features

-  Admin, Customer, and Merchant account management
-  Wallet and transaction operations
-  Authentication & User Roles
  
-  Layered architecture (DAO, Service, Model)  
-  Design Patterns used:
      - **Singleton**: to ensure a single instance of the database connection throughout the application, avoiding multiple unnecessary connections.
      - **State**: to manage user session behavior depending on their states.
      - **Facade**: to provide a simplified interface to coordinate multiple services so the main application logic remains clean and easy to use.
      - **Strategy**: to implements dynamic generation of user matricules based on user types. Makes it easy to extend matricule logic for new user roles.
      - **Adaptor**: to allow the system to register users (especially customers) from external spreadsheet files by converting spreadsheet data formats into the application's internal Customer objects.
-  MySQL database integration (via JDBC)
